# Understanding video streaming algorithms in the wild

In this repo, you'll find all the data to recreate the results shown in 
the ATC2020 paper "Reconstructing proprietary video streaming algorithms."

### Trace Format
Traces are provided in Data/Traces. Each line in the file contains 2 numbers (time, bandwidth), 
where time is in seconds from the start of the script and the bandwidth in Mbps.
### Running the real world DASH experiments
Look at [zdf_tree_server.py](DashExperiments/src/video_server/zdf_tree_server.py) to see how to add your tree to the real world 
evaluation for the video used in [Pensieve](https://github.com/hongzimao/pensieve)
### Generating FeedbackResults
You can regenerate the measurements with the code found in the repository for [Understanding video streaming in the wild](
https://github.com/magruener/understanding-video-streaming-in-the-wild).
### Tree Interpretation
We have made the best trees we were able to generate for a given leaf number restriction available
in the folder trees_visualised. Here we'll provide a short explanation for the composite features
used in the trees. If you want to adapt the code to use your features, have a look at [MLABRPolicy.py](BehaviourCloning/MLABRPolicy.py)
 * Lookahead: How far do we plan. (Only if applicable)
 * Lookback: How many past values do we consider. Depending on the features the 
 lookback can also pertain to just a specific value
 * Buffer Fill / Download Time (s): For each second downloaded how many seconds do we lose/gain
 * (Buffer Fill / Download Time (s)) x Mbit Gain: For each second downloaded how many seconds do we 
 loose/gain weighted by the rate we're obtaining
 * (Buffer Fill / Download Time (s)) x VMAF Gain: For each second downloaded how many seconds do we 
 loose/gain weighted by the VMAF score we're obtaining
 * Linear QoE Normalised: QoE as in the MPC paper, value calculates as the difference of QoE achieved by this action and the 
  minimum QoE achievable. 
 * Linear QoE: QoE as in the MPC paper
 * Buffer Drainage (s): How long did we have to wait for there to be enough space in the buffer so that we can download
 a new chunk
### Incorporating your features
You can manipulate the file [MLABRPolicy.py](BehaviourCloning/MLABRPolicy.py). Be sure to modify the method which
* modifies the feature names
* generates the values
* calculates the number of features
* [tree_mapper.py](Utility/tree_mapper.py) if you want to parse the tree after learning
### Prerequisites
The scripts were tested and developed for Python 3.7 under Ubuntu. 
* Install the python packages needed via requirements.txt

### Example
You can find an example experiment under Experiments
